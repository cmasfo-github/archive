## Data

Data refers to raw facts or figures that are collected through observation or measurement. Data alone has no meaning or context.

## Information

Information is created when data is organized, structured, or processed in a way that gives it meaning and context. Information can be used to answer specific questions or support decision-making.

## Knowledge

Knowledge is created when information is combined with experience, insight, or intuition. Knowledge represents a deeper understanding of a subject and enables individuals to apply information to real-world situations.

## Wisdom

Wisdom is the highest level of understanding and represents the ability to make sound judgments and decisions based on a deep understanding of a subject. Wisdom is often acquired through years of experience and reflection.

## Conclusion

The DIKW model is useful for understanding the different stages of information processing and knowledge creation and can help organizations develop strategies for managing and leveraging their information assets.
