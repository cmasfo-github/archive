# Tacit Knowledge & Explicit Knowledge

Tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge are two types of knowledge that are used to describe how information is shared and transferred within an organization.

## Tacit Knowledge

Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to express or transfer to another person. It is often based on personal experiences, insights, and intuition. Tacit knowledge is often subjective and context-dependent and is often acquired through observation, practice, and personal reflection. Examples of tacit knowledge include skills, expertise, and judgment.

## Explicit Knowledge

Explicit knowledge, on the other hand, is knowledge that can be easily expressed, codified, and transmitted to others. It is often formalized and structured and can be easily communicated through written documents, diagrams, or verbal instructions. Examples of explicit knowledge include procedures, policies, manuals, and technical specifications.

## Distinction

The distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge is important because it affects how knowledge is shared and transferred within an organization. Tacit knowledge is often difficult to articulate and may not be captured by traditional knowledge management systems. To share tacit knowledge effectively, organizations may need to use more informal methods, such as mentoring, storytelling, or apprenticeships. Explicit knowledge, on the other hand, can be easily captured and stored in a knowledge management system and can be easily communicated to others through training, documentation, or other formal methods.

## Conclusion

Both tacit and explicit knowledge are important for organizational learning and knowledge management. To effectively manage knowledge within an organization, it is important to recognize the differences between these two types of knowledge and to develop strategies for capturing, sharing, and transferring both types of knowledge.
