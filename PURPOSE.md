# Purpose

I also use the special repository like another archive.

But this repo is for containing development-related stuffs.

The 'code' dir is about language-specific features.

And the 'docs' dir is about non-language-specific features.

Which might be some theories, ideas, or techniques.

If I need to demonstrate, I'll mainly use Rust for docs contents.
