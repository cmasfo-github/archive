# Qualitative Data & Quantitative Data

Qualitative data and quantitative data are two types of data that are commonly used in research and analysis.

## Qualitative Data

Qualitative data is descriptive in nature and is typically non-numerical. It often includes subjective observations, opinions, and feelings. Examples of qualitative data include interview transcripts, open-ended survey responses, and field notes.

## Qualitative Data

Quantitative data, on the other hand, is numerical in nature and can be measured and analyzed using statistical methods. Examples of quantitative data include survey responses that are scored on a Likert scale, measurements of height and weight, and the number of participants in a study.

## Key Differences

* Type of data

Qualitative data is non-numerical and descriptive in nature, while quantitative data is numerical and measurable.

* Research approach

Qualitative research is often exploratory and focuses on understanding a phenomenon in-depth, while quantitative research is typically more structured and seeks to test hypotheses and make predictions.

* Analysis methods

Qualitative data is analyzed through methods such as thematic analysis, content analysis, and discourse analysis, while quantitative data is analyzed through statistical methods such as regression analysis, t-tests, and ANOVA.

* Sample size

Qualitative research typically involves a smaller sample size, while quantitative research often involves a larger sample size to ensure statistical significance.
