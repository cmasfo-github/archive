# DBMS by Generation

While filesystems are useful for organizing and storing unstructured data, they are not suitable for managing structured data that requires consistency, integrity, and efficient querying. DBMS provide a more powerful and efficient solution for managing structured data in a wide range of applications and industries.

## 1st Gen DBMS

* Hierarchical Model
* Network Model

The first-generation DBMSs were introduced in the 1960s and were primarily based on the hierarchical or network model. They were largely focused on optimizing data storage and retrieval, but were limited in their ability to handle complex relationships between data.

## 2nd Gen DBMS

* Relational Model

The second-generation DBMSs were introduced in the 1970s and were based on the relational model. They allowed for more flexible data access and manipulation through the use of SQL (Structured Query Language). They also introduced the concept of data independence, where application programs could be written without being affected by changes to the underlying data structures.

## 3rd Gen DBMS

* Object-Oriented Model
* Object-Relational Model

The third-generation DBMSs were introduced in the 1980s and were focused on providing better support for distributed databases and client-server architectures. They also introduced the concept of object-oriented databases, which allowed for the storage and manipulation of more complex data types.

## 4th Gen DBMS

Fourth-generation DBMS introduced advanced features such as data warehousing, data mining, and online analytical processing (OLAP). The concept of web-based database applications was also introduced in this generation, which enabled easy access to databases through web browsers. While newer DBMS technologies, such as NoSQL and NewSQL, have emerged since the fourth generation, it remains an important milestone in the history of database management systems.

## 5th Gen DBMS

The fifth-generation DBMSs are still in development and are focused on providing better support for natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. They are also expected to provide better support for unstructured data such as images, audio, and video.
