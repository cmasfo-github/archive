# SQL & NoSQL

SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems (DBMS) used in modern computing.

## SQL

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a relational database management system that is based on a fixed schema or structure. SQL databases are designed to store structured data in tables with pre-defined columns and data types. This allows SQL databases to efficiently manage large amounts of structured data and perform complex queries using SQL.

## NoSQL

NoSQL, or non-relational databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data that cannot be easily organized into tables. NoSQL databases are often schema-less, meaning that data can be added and modified without requiring a fixed schema or structure. NoSQL databases are designed to be more scalable and flexible than SQL databases, making them well-suited for large-scale web applications and data-intensive systems.
