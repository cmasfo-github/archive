# Supervised Learning & Unsupervised Learning

Supervised and unsupervised learning are two important types of machine learning algorithms.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning refers to the process of training a machine learning model on labeled data, where the inputs are paired with corresponding outputs. The goal is to use this data to teach the model to predict the output for new inputs that it has not seen before. The model learns from the labeled examples and tries to find a function that maps the inputs to the outputs. Common supervised learning algorithms include regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, refers to the process of training a machine learning model on unlabeled data, where there are no corresponding output values. The goal is to identify patterns and structure in the data, and to use this information to group similar data points together. This can be useful for tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include k-means clustering, principal component analysis, and self-organizing maps.

## Conclusion

In summary, supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns and structure in unlabeled data without any specific output in mind. Both types of learning are important for different types of tasks in machine learning and have their own set of applications.
