* Structured Data
* Unstructured Data
* Semi-structured Data

Structured data, unstructured data, and semi-structured data are three types of data commonly used in computer science and data analysis.

## Structured Data

Structured data is highly organized and formatted in a specific way so that it can be easily analyzed by computer algorithms. This type of data is typically stored in a relational database, and the structure of the data is defined by a schema or data model. Examples of structured data include spreadsheets, tables, and relational databases.

## Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is not organized in a specific way and does not have a predefined structure. This type of data is often text-heavy and may include multimedia content such as images, videos, and audio recordings. Examples of unstructured data include social media posts, emails, and customer reviews.

## Semi-structured Data

Semi-structured data is a combination of structured and unstructured data. It has some structure, but not as much as structured data. This type of data may have some organization or formatting, but it does not conform to a rigid data model or schema. Examples of semi-structured data include XML and JSON files, which have a defined structure but allow for some flexibility in the data.
